# Python Fivem online / offline alerts

## requirements
- time
- win10toast

## How to use
- clone the repo
- install requirements
- rename config.example.py to config.py
- edit config.py to include the players you want to check and the server`s player.json url
- optional: edit the run.bat to include the path to the script and place in the startup folder

## How it works
- the script will check the player.json file for the players you want to check
- if the player is online it will show a notification
- if the player then goes offline it will show a notification
